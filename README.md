# MNIST-hand-digit-Recognition


This project involves Hand-digit recognition using logistic Regression. 


## Prerequisites

Installation of numpy and Scikit-learn neccesary to run this code.

## Dataset
- Download MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Do not use sklearn built-in functions to load the dataset, as it uses different training and testing set as the website. During evaluation, we will assume the results corresponds to the testing set from the website.
- Use only the training images for training (You can split it into training set and validation set).
- The test set will be used for evaluation.

## Installing

You can install the pre-requisite either in command prompt or in conda prompt (if using anaconda distribution).

For installing numpy,

```
pip install numpy

```

and for installing sklearn,


```
pip install -U scikit-learn
conda install scikit-learn
```
